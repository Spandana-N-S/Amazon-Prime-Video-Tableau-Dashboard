Tableau_Prime_Video_Dashboard
The Amazon Prime Video Dashboard on Tableau is an interactive, professional, and dynamic analytics tool designed to provide users with comprehensive insights into the vast collection of movies and TV shows available on Amazon Prime Video. Leveraging the power of Tableau, this dashboard offers an intuitive interface to explore and analyze essential data related to various shows, including genre, cast, description, duration, release year, and more.

The dashboard includes two powerful visualizations that enrich the user experience. The first is a captivating Radial chart, which showcases the distribution of ratings among the shows. This visually engaging chart presents various ratings such as 13+, R, and more, allowing users to quickly assess the age appropriateness of the content they are interested in.

Additionally, the dashboard features a dynamic World Map representation, providing users with a visual overview of the total number of shows available in different countries. This geographical display enables users to explore content availability across the globe, gaining insights into regional preferences and the diversity of content offered by Amazon Prime Video.
